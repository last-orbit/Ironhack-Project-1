        <h1>Space Wars</h1>
        <section id="game-text"  style="display: none;">
            <p>You find yourself on the bizarre, misty planet of Barfnarf, where colors shift in the air, and strange plants hum with
            an otherworldly tune. You've been tasked with finding Princess Zephyrine, who has mysteriously left her castle. Some say
            she’s been abducted, others whisper she’s on a secret mission, and the rest think she's simply tired of royal life. <br>

 Barfnarf is filled
            with ancient ruins, elusive creatures, and peculiar denizens—each with their own knowledge of the princess's
            disappearance.
            You must find her to prevent the space wars and the  oncoming darkness that would consume the universe. <br>
             If you perish, don't worry we have better choices to accomplish the mission. <br>
